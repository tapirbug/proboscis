# attributed parse trees


would be cool to have at least one type parameter for attributes attached to
each node, maybe with a type each for the different node kinds.

Then we could maybe map and zip attributed parse trees and create extra types
for fast lookup.

also the ast node vec should be a new parse tree type.
